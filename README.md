# libtcrlm

This is the TCR language modelling library that powers SCEPTR.
It is mostly a thin layer around PyTorch with some custom infrastructure.
This should stay closed-source until SCEPTR is published.

## Installation

From your python environment, run the following, replacing `<VERSION_TAG>` with the appropriate version specifier.
The latest release tags can be found by checking the 'releases' section on the github repository page.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yutanagano/libtcrlm.git@<VERSION_TAG>
```
