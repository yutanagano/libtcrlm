# libtcrlm

This is the TCR language modelling library that powers SCEPTR.
It is a thin layer around PyTorch with some extra infrastructure.
Note that this repository only contains library code-- for a readily-usable deployment of SCEPTR, code used to train the models, or code used to conduct the analyses seen in the SCEPTR publication, please see the links below.
